I have interviews today! What do I do?
Don't worry Professor, I will protect you!
    You should run to the Tatham Centre!

    How do I get there?
    How can I protect myself?
    Got it. Thanks Professor!

        You must fend off the Geese! Moving onto a Goose's tile will attack that Goose.

        How can I get a Goose to stop attacking me?

            You must attack that Goose until it flees (when its health reaches 0)
